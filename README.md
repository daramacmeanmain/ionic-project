# ionic-project

Todo list app that allows you to creat new tasks and set a date for them. Checkbox in place to tick off completed tasks.

I'd also like to add, I had some issues involving Ionic where I had pretty limited usability. The "ionic" command would only run in the AppData directory, if I tried using it anywhere else I get the following error.

Though I was able to run the programme in the project file by using "start ionic serve".

As a side-effect of this I was unable to compile the app for android, as trying to do so in the AppData folder gave me an error.
